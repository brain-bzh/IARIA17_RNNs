# IARIA17_RNNs
Results shown on the IARIA 2017 paper "An Intrinsic Difference Between Vanilla RNNs And GRU Models".     
This repository is decomposed into 3 notebooks that reproduce our results:    
-RegularReberGrammar.ipynb: reproduce the experiment with Vanilla RNNs and Regular Reber's grammar.    
-EmbeddedReberGrammar.ipynb: reproduce the experiment with Vanilla RNNs, GRU RNNs and Embedded Reber's grammar. (to be upload)
-lk-discrepancy.ipynb: show the calculus of the (l,k)-discrepancy introduced in the last part of the paper.
